        <h1>Education and Career: Show me the money</h1>   
        
        <h2>The lifelong benefits of attending certain universities have been widely discussed in the news of late. As such, it seemed a timely opportunity to look at how education can influence careers in finance.</h2>
        

        <div class="text-content">
            <p>📌 Across the London offices of 102 private equity funds (from lower mid-cap through to large cap) covering over 2000 investment professionals, nearly 40% went to one of only ten institutions for their undergraduate degree. 16.83% went to Oxbridge (Oxford beating Cambridge this time with 9.74% to 7.09%). This leaves 345 other featured institutions, 199 of which are represented by a lone graduate.</p>
            
            <p>📊 Our top ten is perhaps surprisingly UK centric with only two continental institutions making the cut (even when including Grande École and other intercalated programmes). Bocconi comes in a distant third (4.34%) with HEC Paris sneaking in at number ten (1.75%). Given continental universities perform better across investment banking, this suggests candidates have more opportunities to return to their home countries once they’ve moved to the buyside.</p>
            
            <p>🔍 So prevalent are the top ten that we only found a single firm (a four-person lower mid-market team) that didn’t feature someone with a bachelor's degree from at least one of them.</p>
            
            <p>🚀 Clearly decisions made as a teenager heavily impact future career opportunities. Given how background can affect available opportunities at that age, perhaps firms need to look beyond simply seeking certain brand names on a CV. More readily taking into account personal trajectory across education and early career could lead to both greater team diversity and hires with a history of outperformance.</p>
