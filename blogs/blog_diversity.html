        <h1>Diversity within the Big4 and Investment Banking</h1> 
            
        <h2>We were curious to explore how the composition of corporate finance teams within the Big 4 compares to those in investment banking. After analysing the backgrounds of nearly 11,000 UK-based professionals, this is what we found.</h2>

                <h3>Gender Diversity</h3>
                
                <p>üìä The Big4 exhibit a more balanced female to male ratio of 34:66, compared to 25:75 in investment banking. Interestingly, within the Big4 there is little variance (despite significantly different headcount across firms). Amongst the banks we found significant positive correlation between size of team and level of gender diversity.</p>
                
                <p>üìâ As observed in a previous post, there‚Äôs a strong inverse relationship between seniority levels and gender diversity in investment banking. Although slightly less pronounced across the Big4, the same relationship exists.</p>

                <h3>Educational Diversity</h3>
                
                <p>üéì Both Investment Banking and the Big4 tend to target talent from narrow graduate talent pools, with more than 20% of hires coming from only five institutions in both cases. However, the calibre of these institutions differs, with Oxbridge, LSE and leading European business schools featuring far more prominently in investment banking. Investment banking also seems to place a higher premium on advanced degrees, with nearly 60% of its workforce pursuing postgraduate education and 7% going for a post-experience MBA, as opposed to 29% and 4% respectively, at the Big4. It is possible that some of the difference here is a reflection of educational norms internationally given the enduring cosmopolitanism of banking in the UK.</p>
                
                <p>üìö Whereas non-graduates are almost non-existent within investment banking, the Big4‚Äôs apprenticeship schemes seem a viable route into finance for individuals considering not attending university, particularly outside London. We found 2.5% of employees in London teams to be non-graduates compared to 4.7% for offices across the rest of the country.</p>

                <h3>Ethnic Diversity</h3>
                
                <p>üåê The two talent pools display virtually equal levels of ethnic diversity, with around one in every four professionals coming from an ethnic minority background. Nevertheless, as employees in both Big4 and IB advance up the corporate hierarchy, minority representation decreases. Only 10% of Partners, Managing Directors and Heads of Department in the Big4 come from a minority ethnic background, with the figure being 17% in Investment Banking.</p>
                
                <p>üìç Within the Big4, we found considerable variance across regional offices with teams in Scotland and the North exhibiting as low as 10% minority representation and those in Reading averaging nearly 40% (notably higher than in London). Irrespective of location, teams are significantly less diverse than the general populations of the cities in which offices are located (which in turn, are more diverse than their surrounding regions).</p>
